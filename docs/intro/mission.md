# UKO Schedulers Mission

The schedulers subgroup of UKO exists to educate students at the University of
Minnesota about the schedulers in operating systems.

The group will work on extending MIT's [xv6](/docs/xv6/xv6.md) operating system.

Goals include:

* Understand the xv6 scheduler.
* Implement an xv6 profiler for performance recording.
* Modify and improve scheduling performance in xv6.
* More to come.
